## Handover

Is it just about handing over designs from the designer/UXer to the developer?
Tools can help with this!

But it is about much more than this. It is all about communication. Some of these tools enable and improve the communication and help us track intent and purpose more clearly, but we still need those face-to-face conversations.

## Tools

* InVision
  * DSM
  * Inspect
  * Storybook integration
  * Design Tokens
* Abstract
* Zeplin
* Figma

Could a Design System help with this?
